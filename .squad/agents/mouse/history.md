- **Created:** 2026-04-19

## Key Reference

- Target audience: NGO administrative staff (clarity over aesthetics)
- Desktop app context: larger screens, keyboard + mouse primary input

- Multi-language support needed (Spanish + English) — affects layout
- Financial data display: tables, numbers, currency formatting
- Dashboard: balance cards, monthly charts

## Learnings

<!-- Append new learnings below. Each entry is something lasting about the project. -->

## 2026-04-19 — Team Context Update (from Scribe)
- ADR-001 (Proposed) at `docs/architecture/adr-001-tech-stack.md` — Neo recommends Option A (React+TS, append-only event-sourced JSON, `age` encryption).
- Security Requirements v0.1 at `docs/security/security-requirements-v0.1.md` — Switch: 20 requirements, 15 stack constraints, 8 accepted risks, 6 open questions for Pedro.
- Both are team context now.

### 2026-04-19: ADR-001 Accepted — UX constraints locked
ADR-001 is Accepted. Implementation constraints locked: no passphrase UI in v1 (OS keychain handles it silently); device enrollment needs a QR-code / 6-char visual-code pairing UX flow. Consider UX implications in upcoming specs.
