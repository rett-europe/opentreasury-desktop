# Squad Decisions

## Active Decisions

### 2026-04-19: Project scope — OpenTreasury Desktop
**By:** Pedro (project owner)
**What:** Build a desktop Electron app that replicates the functionality of rett-europe/opentreasury without requiring complex cloud setup (Azure, Cosmos DB, Entra ID). Tech stack beyond Electron is TBD.
**Why:** NGOs need simpler deployment — download and run, no Azure subscription required.

### 2026-04-19: Switch has FINAL SAY on security
**By:** Pedro (project owner)
**What:** Switch (Security Engineer) has final say on all security decisions — non-negotiable. Always adopt the most secure option.
**Why:** Financial data for NGOs requires rigorous security posture.

### 2026-04-19: Transaction list starts empty
**By:** Pedro (project owner)
**What:** Transaction list page starts EMPTY — user must select a date range (or preset) before data loads. No auto-loading on page open.
**Why:** UX decision from the cloud version — prevents overwhelming users with stale data.
